## iMoto

We use nanobox.io to develop and deploy, it's great.

`boxfile.yml` contains the setup for running locally (`run.config`) and deploy (`deploy.config`).

We use Google Compute as the host service, our cluster is in SÃ£o Paulo.


## Running locally

`$ nanobox run`

`$ mix phx.server`


## Deploy

`$ nanobox deploy`
